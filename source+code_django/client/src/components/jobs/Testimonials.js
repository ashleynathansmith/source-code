                    Ash is great. He found me an amazing lead front-end dev who is seriously talented, and I think will be with us for the long-haul. Ash listens to feedback, is highly personable, delivers good candidates, and his fees are very reasonable too. Id happily work with him again.

                    Ash was a refreshing change compared to other recruiters that had been in touch. He had a clear understanding of the open source technologies used by the company and was able to identify a good match in myself for the job available.

Ash really went the extra mile to keep me in the loop without disruption to my normal work day.

Would be happy to recommend Ash to anyone.

                    From his very first introduction message Ash was friendly, polite and not pushy; a refreshing change from the average recruiter. Ash perfectly matched my skillset with the role he was recruiting for and communicated daily with me throughout the process; nothing was ever too much to ask. Based on how well he recruited me I wouldnt hesitate in approaching him for future roles. Excellent recruiter!

                    Ash has been the only excellent experience I had with a recruiter.
He has a really good understanding of the IT Market and was able provide me exactly what I was looking for.
I was abroad when he contacted me and he never hesitated to call me on his free time to make it simpler for me. With an 8 hour difference it was really hard to manage my job search but he did everything in order to make it easier! Thanks Ash!
