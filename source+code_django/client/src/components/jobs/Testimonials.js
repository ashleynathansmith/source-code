                      <q>Ash is great. He found me an amazing lead front-end dev who is seriously talented, and I think will be with us for the long-haul. Ash listens to feedback, is highly personable, delivers good candidates, and his fees are very reasonable too. Id happily work with him again.</q>

                      <q>Ash was a refreshing change compared to other recruiters that had been in touch. He had a clear understanding of the open source technologies used by the company and was able to identify a good match in myself for the job available. Ash really went the extra mile to keep me in the loop without disruption to my normal work day. I would be happy to recommend Ash to anyone.</q>

                      <q>From his very first introduction message Ash was friendly, polite and not pushy; a refreshing change from the average recruiter. Ash perfectly matched my skillset with the role he was recruiting for and communicated daily with me throughout the process; nothing was ever too much to ask. Based on how well he recruited me I wouldnt hesitate in approaching him for future roles. Excellent recruiter!</q>

                      <q>Ash has been the only excellent experience I had with a recruiter. He has a really good understanding of the IT Market and was able provide me exactly what I was looking for. I was abroad when he contacted me and he never hesitated to call me on his free time to make it simpler for me. With an 8 hour difference it was really hard to manage my job search but he did everything in order to make it easier! Thanks Ash</q>
